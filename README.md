Time series forecasting has been used to predict the future outcome of various fields such as economics, finance, and medical which has a great impact on our day to day lives. In time series dataset observations are recorded at regular intervals.  Various models such as ARMIA, SARIMA have been traditionally used to predict the next lags of time series which work well with good accuracy and precision. Since the advancement in areas of Deep learning, neural networks are also used for predictions and provide great results on various kinds of time series dataset having features like non-linearity. Prophet Model developed by Facebook for the purpose of forecasting time series is easy to use and works well with outliers, missing values, holiday effects in the dataset. In this paper, the performance of 3 models ARIMA, PROPHET and NAARN is evaluated using RMSE metric. The forecasting is done on four economic datasets of Federal reserve bank of St. Louis. The result shows that the average performance of Prophet is better than ARIMA and average performance of NAARN is better than Prophet.
